    <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p align=justify>Like many aspiring EVA's today I had limited knowledge on the purview of a VA. I had a short-lived career as a BPO employee, I was a former overseas worker and when the time came for me to switch path, the idea of freelancing or working remotely was the viable route to take. But, I felt fearful, confused on where to start, how to land an interview among many others.
        <br>
        <br>
Everyday I took a portion of my time to understand the trade, I learned how digital marketing works, and I familiarized most common software of today that are deployed by modern internet centric business. It was a long and daunting task bit I held on to it. One article from Huffpost said - Everything you ever wanted is in the other side of fear - and it could never be more truthful than that. Fight your fears and you will be in battle. Face your fears and you will be free forever.
I have since worked with very successful businesses over the years, I helped drew interests and sales from their audience, managed their services and expanded their reach and exposure online.
<br>
<br>
It was a trek filled with challenges, challenges that brought me to a new lasting and fulfilling career. And now, I felt it's time for me to share the experiences I had through the years, in hopes that I could also extend help those who are working to embark towards a freelancing career.</p>
